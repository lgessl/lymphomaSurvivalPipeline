\title{Prepare data for model fitting and predicting}
\usage{
prepare(
  directory,
  model,
  include_from_continuous_pheno = NULL,
  include_from_discrete_pheno = NULL,
  expr_fname = "expr.csv",
  pheno_fname = "pheno.csv"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{directory}{string. The directory where both expression and
pheno data files lie.}

\item{model}{string. For which model to prepare. One of
\itemize{
\item \code{"cox_lasso_zerosum"} (Cox proportional hazards with LASSO reularization
and zero-sum constraint)
\item \code{"lasso_zerosum"} (ordinary linear regression with LASSO regularization)
}}

\item{include_from_continuous_pheno}{vector of strings. The names of the
\emph{continuous} variables in the pheno data file to be included in the
predictor matrix. The values will be coerced to numeric. Default is \code{NULL},
which means no continuous pheno variables will be included.}

\item{include_from_discrete_pheno}{vector of strings. The names of the
\emph{discrete} variables in the pheno data file to be included in the predictor
matrix. A discrete variable with n levels will be converted to n-1 binary
variables. Default is \code{NULL}, which means no discrete pheno variables will
be included.}

\item{expr_fname}{string. The name of the expression .csv file inside \code{directory}.
Default is \code{"expr.csv"}.}

\item{pheno_fname}{string. The name of the pheno data .csv inside \code{directory}.
Default is \code{"pheno.csv"}.}
}
\value{
A list with two elements, \code{x} and \code{y}. \code{x} is the predictor matrix, \code{y} is
the respondent matrix with the samples as rows.
}
\description{
Read data from files, generate the predictor and
respondent matirx and control quality.
}
\details{
The pheno .csv files holds the samples as rows (with the unique sample names
in the very first column), the variables as columns. We need at least the columns
\itemize{
\item progression (integer, 0 for censored, 1 for uncensored),
\item pfs_yrs (integer, the time in years to progression or censoring),
\item \code{Ã¬nclude_from_continuous_pheno},
\item \code{include_from_discrete_pheno}.
The expr .csv file holds the genes as rows (with the unique gene names in the very
first column), the samples as columns. The sample names in pheno and expression files
must be identical and in the same order.
