Description: This package provides tools to train classifiers predicting 
    progression-free survival for lymphoma patients. It makes integrating
    new data sets, new classes of models and new features easy. It prepares
    data (which is expected to have a certain format) for training models
    and assesses each model, most importantly in terms of prevalence versus
    precision.
