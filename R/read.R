#' @title Read expression and pheno data from csv files into tibbles
#' @description Read expression and pheno csv files into tibbles and move
#' patient and gene identifiers to row names.
#' @param directory string. The directory where both expression and pheno csv
#' files lie.
#' @param expr_fname string. The name of the expression .csv file inside `directory`.
#' See details for the expected format.
#' @param pheno_fname string. The name of the pheno data .csv inside `directory`.
#' See details for the expected format.
#' @param patient_id_col string. The name of the column in the pheno data file
#' that holds the patient identifiers.
#' @param gene_col string. The name of the column in the expression data file
#' that holds the gene identifiers.
#' @details The pheno .csv files holds the samples as rows (with the unique sample names
#'  in the very first column), the variables as columns. We need at least the columns
#'  * progression (integer, 0 for censored, 1 for uncensored),
#'  * pfs_yrs (integer, the time in years to progression or censoring),
#'  * `Ã¬nclude_from_continuous_pheno`,
#'  * `include_from_discrete_pheno` and
#'  * `patient_id_col`.
#' The expr .csv file holds the genes as rows (with the unique genes in a row called 
#' `gene_col`), the samples as columns. The sample names in pheno and expression files
#' must be identical and in the same order.
